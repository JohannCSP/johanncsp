### Still deciding between a software engineer and a data scientist? Why not both!? ðŸ¤”

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Johann. I started my career as a software engineer and slowly gravitated with the industry toward data science. I have a very unique set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a 10-year long career. Skills that blend software development, data mining and machine learning techniques combined with extensive problem-solving and customer-facing experience. If you let me collaborate in your organization I will help you discover invaluable insights from the most complex datasets and I will optimize your data processing pipelines not only for functional completeness but also for stellar performance. âœ¨

I am proficient in applying a wide range of ML models, clustering algorithms, similarity metrics and creating effective data visualizations. Get to know about the quality of my work in my most recent projects below.
